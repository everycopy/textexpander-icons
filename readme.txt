TextExpander Menu Bar Icons

About

-----------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been a satisfied customer of SmileOnMyMac’s TextExpander for
years. However, I’ve never really been happy with the selection
of icons for the menu item. They always felt too large in the
context of the menubar and — quite frankly — a bit fuzzy looking.

After creating a revamped set of icons and posting the results to
Dribbble, I decided to make them available to everyone.
