About

-----------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been a satisfied customer of SmileOnMyMac’s TextExpander for
years. However, I’ve never really been happy with the selection
of icons for the menu item. They always felt too large in the
context of the menubar and — quite frankly — a bit fuzzy looking.

After creating a revamped set of icons and posting the results to
Dribbble, I decided to make them available to everyone.

There are currently two versions of replacement icons:

+ Flat

This set is the original, minimalist version that I had first
envisioned as a replacement. They have a simple, two dimensional
look with just a slight gradient shading.

+ Inset

This set sports a subtle white “shadow” on the bottom edge,
mimicking the appearance of Apple’s menu extra icons. They use
the same gradient shading as the Flat version.
