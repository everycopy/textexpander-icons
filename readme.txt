TextExpander Menu Bar Icons

About

-----------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been a satisfied customer of SmileOnMyMac’s TextExpander for
years. However, I’ve never really been happy with the selection
of icons for the menu item. They always felt too large in the
context of the menubar and — quite frankly — a bit fuzzy looking.

After creating a revamped set of icons and posting the results to
Dribbble, I decided to make them available to everyone.

Subsequently forked by James Goode, who added a balloon version.

There are currently four versions of replacement icons:

+ Minimal Flat - by Grant Hutchinson

This set is the original, minimalist version that I had first
envisioned as a replacement. They have a simple, two dimensional
look with just a slight gradient shading.

+ Minimal Inset - by Grant Hutchinson

This set sports a subtle white “shadow” on the bottom edge,
mimicking the appearance of Apple’s menu extra icons. They use
the same gradient shading as the Flat version.

+ Balloon (Flat & Inset) - by James Goode

Made in homage to TextExpander’s venerable balloon logo. This set
tries to match Apple’s menu bar icons as closely as possible,
eschewing the gradient shading of the minimal versions.
